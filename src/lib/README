* Under lib/ dir, create subdir for developing C/C++ libraries.
  - mkdir $SB/src/lib/libfoo/

* Developing the C/C++ Library

 - cd $SB/src/lib
 - create subdir for application library (eg: libfoo)

 - Develop the code under $SB/src/lib/libfoo
 - Auto-generate library Makefile or write manually.
   Write JSON file for auto-generating app Makefile and packaging related files.
   (see how-to-write-package-json-file for more details)
   NOTE: The auto-generated app Makefile will be correct for most of the general
   cases; if there are any external library depedencies, it should be tweaked accordingly.
 - Run 'mk' and build the lib alone for quick testing.
   Eg: cd $SB/src/lib/libfoo; mk
   NOTE: The object files can be found here: $SB/junos-jet-sb-obj/<machine>/lib/libfoo
   OR $SB/junos-jet-sb-obj/bsd10/<machine>/lib/libfoo (for bsd10 occam builds)
