Procedure to build the JET app package
  - After development of the app completes and all Makefile/manifest are ready,
    the app can be built and packaged.
  - cd <sandbox-path>/src/
  - Run: mk <app-name> (eg: mk echoclient)
    NOTE: Default mk will built for target i386; to build for other platforms,
    run mk-<arch> (eg: mk-powerpc, mk-octeon)
  - The app will be compiled and app package (.tgz file) gets generated in
    /home/<user>/workspace/mysampleapp/junos-jet-sb-obj/ship/ path.

  Eg: After building the echoclient sample app, the package is generated in below path:
  [root@myvm ~]# cd/home/<user>/workspace/mysampleapp/junos-jet-sb-obj/ship>ls
  echoclient-15.2R1.1.tgz
  echoclient-15.2R1.1tgz.sha1
