* Under python/ dir, create subdir for developing python apps.
  - mkdir $SB/src/python/mypythonapp

* Developing Python apps

 - cd $SB/src/python
 - create subdir for python application (eg: mypythonapp)

 - Develop the code under $SB/src/python/mypythonapp
 - Auto-generate app Makefile or write manually.
   Write JSON file for auto-generating app Makefile and packaging related files.
   (see how-to-write-package-json-file for more details)
   NOTE: The auto-generated app Makefile will be correct for most of the general
   cases; if there are any external library depedencies, it should be tweaked accordingly.
 - Run 'mk' and build the python app alone for quick testing.
   Eg: cd $SB/src/python/mypythonapp; mk
   NOTE: The object files can be found here: $SB/junos-jet-sb-obj/<machine>/python/mypythonapp
   OR $SB/junos-jet-sb-obj/bsd10/<machine>/python/mypythonapp (for bsd10 occam builds)
 - If python app depends on any C/C++ libraries, the libs should be developed under $SB/src/lib/.
